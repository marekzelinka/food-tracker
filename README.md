# Food Tracker

This project is a simple food tracking app that I've created while learning JavaScript

## Setup

**First time**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marekzelinka/food-tracker.git
cd food-tracker
pnpm install
```

**Then you can run the server**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Go to [localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
