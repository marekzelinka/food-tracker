# Food Tracker

This project is a simple food-tracking app that I created while learning JavaScript.

## Setup

**First time**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marekzelinka/food-tracker.git
cd food-tracker
pnpm install
```

**Create a `.env.local` by using `.env.example` as a template**

```bash
# Don't forget to replace {namespace} with any word of your choice.
VITE_API_NAMESPACE="namespace"
```

**Then you can run the server**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Go to [localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
